Swlkup is an application to manage a database of supervisors and provide anonymous access for authorized users.

## Start

The easiest way to start a reproducible build of the fullstack application, is calling the [`nix Flake`](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) from the toplevel directory:

```
nix run
```

If you don't have `nix`, you can use [this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/johannesloetzsch/nix-flake).

Alternatively you can start the backend and frontend separately as described in the according directories.
